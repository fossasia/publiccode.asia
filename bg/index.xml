      <description>Publicly funded software has to be Free and Open Source Software. While there are plenty of good reasons for this, many politicians don&amp;rsquo;t know about them yet.
Free and Open Source Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve software.
 This is where you can help! Sign the open initiative to give our message more weight.  8 people and  1 organisations have already signed.</description>
