1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Imagine for a moment

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,900
our government would treat our public infrastructure,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,100
like our streets and public buildings,

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,480
the same way it treats our digital infrastructure:

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,560
Our members of parliament would work in a rented space

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,360
where they weren't allowed to vote in favor of stricter environmental laws

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,240
because the owner - a multinational corporation -

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,580
didn't allow that kind of voting in its buildings.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,240
Nor will it allow a long overdue upgrade

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,240
to more than 500 seats.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,820
This means some members of parliament have to stay outside, in the street.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,940
And a couple of blocks away

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,960
a brand new gym is already being torn down,

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,460
just six months after it was built.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,440
It's being replaced with an exact replica -

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,020
at great expense.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,440
And the only difference:

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,460
The new manufacturer also provides "Streetball" as an added feature.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,620
Meanwhile,

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,620
every night, through a hidden backdoor in the city hall,

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,920
documents that contain sensitive information on citizens,

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
from bank data to healthcare records,

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
are being stolen.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,060
But no one is allowed to do anything about it,

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,760
because searching for backdoors and locking them

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,840
would infringe the signed user agreement.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,540
And as absurd as this sounds,

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,120
when it comes to our digital infrastructure -

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,220
things like the software and programs

30
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,560
that our governments are using everyday -

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,660
this comparison is pretty accurate.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,040
Because mostly,

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,820
our administrations procure proprietary software.

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,420
This means a lot of money goes into licenses

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,960
that last for a limited amount of time

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,360
and restrict our rights.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,000
We aren't allowed to use our infrastructure

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
in a reasonable way.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,580
And because the source code of proprietary software

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,320
is usually a business secret,

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,640
finding security holes or deliberately installed backdoors

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,960
is extremely difficult and even illegal.

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,580
But our public administrations can do better!

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,540
If all publicly financed software were to be Free and Open Source,

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,440
we could use and share our infrastructure

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,140
for anything and for as long as we wanted.

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,140
We could upgrade it,

48
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,140
repair it,

49
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,580
and remodel it

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,360
in any way to fit our needs.

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,800
And because the "Open Source" in Free Software means

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,080
that the blueprint is openly readable for everyone,

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,860
this makes it much easier to find and close security holes.

54
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,660
And if something practical and reliable was created digitally,

55
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,100
not only can you reuse the blueprint all over your country,

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,960
but the actual thing itself can be deployed anywhere,

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
even internationally!

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,580
A great example of this is "FixMyStreet":

59
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,460
Originally developed in Great Britain

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,420
as a Free Software app to report,

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
view and discuss local problems

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,940
like potholes,

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,080
it's now being used all over the world.

64
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,700
Everyone benefits

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,960
because new features and improvements

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
are shared by everyone.

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
If all our software were developed like this,

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,220
we could stop struggling with restrictive licenses

69
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,860
and could start thinking about where and how

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
software could help us.

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,040
We could concentrate

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,920
on creating a better society for everyone.

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,200
So, if you think that tomorrow's infrastructure

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,460
should be in our own hands,

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,680
help us now by sharing this video

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,460
and visiting our website:

77
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
www.publiccode.asia

78
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,460
It's time to make our demand:

79
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,180
Public money?

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,940
Public code!
